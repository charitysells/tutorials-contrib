== Run Your First Analytics Query

Couchbase Cloud comes equipped with a powerful MPP-based analytics service that provides a parallel data-management capability; allowing the running of complex queries against millions of records without any impact to overall database performance. 

. Create Analytics datasets
+
Analytics datasets are containers that hold collections of JSON objects. They are similar to tables in an RDBMS or keyspaces in N1QL. 
A dataset is linked to a Couchbase bucket, so that the dataset can ingest data from Couchbase Server.
+
Create an analytics dataset using data from the `beer-sample` bucket by following these steps.

.. Log in to your Couchbase Cloud account, then click Clusters in the side navigation. 
+
Click your cluster name to display the cluster overview screen. 

.. In the Tools menu, select Analytics Workbench.
+
image::analytics-bi/abi3.png[Select the Analytics Workbench from the Tools menu on your cluster overview screen.]
+
The Analytics Editor is displayed.
+
image::analytics-bi/abi4.png[The Analytics Editor is displayed]

.. In the Analytics Editor, paste this statement to create a dataset of breweries made up of all “brewery” type documents in the beer-sample bucket.
+
[source,n1ql]
----
CREATE DATASET breweries ON `beer-sample` WHERE `type` = "brewery";
----
+
Click Execute to create the dataset.
+
You will see the brewery dataset with a yellow indicator to the right of the editor.
+

.. Next create a dataset of beers made up of all “beer” type documents in the beer-sample bucket.
+
[source,n1ql]
----
CREATE DATASET beers ON `beer-sample` WHERE `type` = "beer";
----
+
Click Execute. The beers dataset appears with a yellow indicator to the right of the editor
+
image::analytics-bi/abi7.png[The beers dataset with a yellow indicator is displayed to the right of the Analytics Editor]

. Link the Analytics Datasets to Your Local 
+
To link the datasets to your local beer-sample bucket, paste the following statement into the Analytics Editor:
+
[source,n1ql]
----
CONNECT LINK Local;
----
+
Click Execute. The datasets should display to the right of the Analytics Editor each with a green icon, indicating successful dataset creation.
+
image::analytics-bi/abi8.png[When the datasets are created, they are displayed to the right of the Analytics Editor, each with a green icon.]
+
You have just created 2 datasets linked to your local beer-sample bucket. 

. Now you can analyze the data using N1QL for Analytics.
+
A big advantage is that N1QL for Analytics can construct new objects to return based on combinations of variable bindings. 
This gives it the power to do projections and joins much like those done using multi-table FROM clauses in SQL. 
For example, suppose that you wanted a list of all breweries paired with their associated beers, with the list enumerating the brewery name and the beer name for each such pair. You can do this as follows in N1QL for Analytics while also limiting the answer set size to 3 results.
+
Copy and paste the following query into to the Analytics Editor:
+
[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT bw.name AS brewer, br.name AS beer
FROM breweries bw, beers br
WHERE br.brewery_id = meta(bw).id
ORDER BY bw.name, br.name
LIMIT 3;
----
+
Click Execute.
+
image::analytics-bi/abi10.png[The results of your first analytics query are displayed]
+
Congratulations! You just ran your first analytics query and see the results in the Analytics Editor.

== Run an Analytics Query with JOINs 

Now let's try a more advanced N1QL for Analytics query using JOINs. 

JOINs enable you to join datasets for richer analysis.

Left outer joins are particularly important in SQL, for example, to print a summary of customers and orders grouped by customer, without omitting those customers who haven’t placed any orders yet.

N1QL for Analytics supports nesting, both of queries and of query results, and the combination allows for a cleaner and more natural approach to such queries. As an example, suppose you want each brewery to produce an object that contains the brewery name along with a list of all of the brewery’s offered beer names and alcohol percentages. In the flat (also known as 1NF) world of SQL, approximating this query would involve a left outer join between breweries and beers, ordered by brewery, with the brewery name being repeated along side each beer’s information. In the richer (NoSQL) world of N1QL for Analytics this use case can be handled more naturally as follows.

Copy the following query and paste it into the Analytics Editor:

[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT bw.name AS brewer,
  (SELECT br.name, br.abv FROM beers br
   WHERE br.brewery_id = meta(bw).id
   ORDER BY br.name) AS beers
FROM breweries bw
ORDER BY bw.name
LIMIT 2;
----

Click Execute. The results are displayed as follows:

image::analytics-bi/abi11.png[The results of your left outer join query using N1QL for Analytics are displayed]

Congratulations, you have successfully created analytics datasets using data in your Couchbase Cloud cluster, and have used N1QL to query and join the datasets.

== Visualizing Data on Couchbase Cloud Using Business Intelligence Tools

Couchbase Cloud Analytics can be analyzed directly using popular business intelligence tools.

=== Prerequisites

. In this example we will utilize https://www.tableau.com/trial/download-tableau[Tableau Desktop] to visualize data in a Couchbase Cloud Analytics Dataset leveraging the https://www.cdata.com/drivers/couchbase/jdbc/[CData JDBC Driver For Couchbase]. To complete this exercise you can download and install the free trials of Tableau Desktop and the CData driver if you don’t already have these tools installed.

. You must also have your Couchbase Cloud cluster endpoint URL and your cluster Security Certificate handy to make the connection to Couchbase Cloud using the CData JDBC connector.
+
.. To get these settings, click Clusters in the side menu then click on your cluster name.
+
..Click the Connect tab to display the cluster endpoint and security certificate.
+
..Copy the Couchbase Cloud cluster endpoint URL and your cluster Security Certificate for entering into the CData JDBC driver for Couchbase.
