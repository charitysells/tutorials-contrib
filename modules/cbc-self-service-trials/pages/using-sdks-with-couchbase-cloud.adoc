= Using SDKs with Couchbase Cloud
:imagesdir: ../assets/images

This is the second tutorial in the series of “First Timer” tutorials. By following the steps in order, you will end up with a sample application that illustrates how Couchbase Cloud can power your own applications. Let's get going!

[#install-couchbase-sdk]
== Install Couchbase Node.js SDK 

. Visit the xref:home::sdk.adoc[Couchbase SDK] page on Couchbase Documentation site.

This page gives you an overview of the SDKs available for you to develop Couchbase Cloud powered applications.
+
For the purpose of this tutorial, we will be using the Couchbase Node.js SDK.

. Click the Node.js SDK link. 
+
image::connect-sdk-cbc/sdk2a.png[Select the Node.js SDK]
+
This takes you to the Node.js SDK documentation. In the left-hand navigation, select xref:nodejs-sdk:hello-world:start-using-sdk.adoc[Start Using the Node.js SDK].
+
image::connect-sdk-cbc/sdk3.png[In the left-hand navigation of the Node.js SDK documentation, select "Start Using the Node.js SDK"]
+

. Follow the instructions to xref:nodejs-sdk:hello-world:start-using-sdk.adoc#installing-the-sdk[install the Node.js SDK].
+
Copy and paste the code snippets into your IDE of choice.

[#connect-sdk-to-cloud]
== Connect Couchbase Node.js SDK to Couchbase Cloud

. Once you have installed Couchbase Node.js SDK, proceed to the step titled xref:nodejs-sdk:hello-world:start-using-sdk.adoc#hello-couchbase[Hello Couchbase].
+
When copying and pasting the code to your own code editor, substitute your own Couchbase Cloud endpoint and database username and password.

.. Replace the word "localhost" in the following line with your cluster endpoint.
+
----
const cluster = new couchbase.Cluster("couchbase://localhost", 
{
----
+
To the end of your endpoint URL, paste this parameter string:
+
----
?ssl=no_verify&console_log_level=5
----
+
The cluster URL now looks something like this:
+
----
couchbase://922de0-d289-455e-a873-2597aa59.dp.cloud.couchbase.com?ssl=no_verify&console_log_level=5
----

.. Replace the word "Administrator" with your cluster database user in the following line:
+
----
username: "Administrator",
----

.. Replace the word "password" with your cluster database user password in the following line:
+
----
password: "password",
----
+

NOTE: For the purpose of this tutorial, you can safely ignore the text referring to an alternate “Cloud section” on the documentation page and referring to the localhost installation - they do not apply in this exercise.


[#your-first-app-hello-couchbase]
== Run your First App: Hello Couchbase

Move to the next code block and continue copying and pasting the code from the exercise into your code editor.

Complete all the steps on the xref:nodejs-sdk:hello-world:start-using-sdk.adoc[Install and Start Using the Node.js SDK with Couchbase Server] page (making the appropriate changes to the connection endpoint and database username and password for your Couchbase Cloud cluster).

When you run the index.js sample code, it should successfully upload a new document to your Couchbase Cloud “travel-sample” bucket, specifically for a new airline called “Couchbase Airways”

Congratulations, you’ve just developed your first application that interacts with Couchbase Cloud!


[#run-sample-app]
== Run Couchbase Node.js SDK Sample Application

Now we will connect a more fully developed Node.js sample application to your Couchbase Cloud cluster.

Go to the Node.js SDK documentation page for xref:nodejs-sdk:hello-world:sample-application.adoc[sample application].

image::connect-sdk-cbc/sdk5.png[Node.js SDK documentation page for sample application]

The Couchbase Cloud Node.js Sample Application shows you how to program interactions with the Couchbase Server via the data, Query, and search services — using the Travel Sample Application called CB Travel with the travel-sample data bucket on your Couchbase Cloud cluster.

The sample app requires the “hotels” Full Text Seach index that you created in the previous tutorial in the series: xref:cbc-self-service-trials:getting-started.adoc[Getting Started with Couchbase Cloud Free Trial].

NOTE: Because you are using Couchbase Cloud, and your Full Text Search index is already created, you can ignore the preamble on the page about server installation and search index.

=== Install the Sample Application

On the Node.js Sample Application page under “Preparation”, follow the instructions to get the sample app from github.

In the section “Running the Travel Sample Application”, follow these instructions to edit the `index.js` file in the application code.

. Open `index.js` for editing.

. Find the commented line that says “// Create a Couchbase Cluster connection” (around line 13). You will edit the cluster URL, username and password under the commented line.

. Find and replace “localhost” with your Couchbase Cloud cluster endpoint.

. Paste the following parameter string to end of the endpoint URL: 
+
`?ssl=no_verify&console_log_level=5`
+
The cluster URL now looks something like the following:
+
----
couchbase://922de0-d289-455e-a873-2597aa59.dp.cloud.couchbase.com?ssl=no_verify&console_log_level=5
----

. Find and replace “Administrator” with your cluster database username.

. Find and replace “password” with your cluster database user password.
+

. After making the adjustments to `index.js`, save the file.

. Follow the remaining instructions on the Node.js Sample Application page to build and run the Sample Application, then log in to the app at http://localhost:8080.
+
image::connect-sdk-cbc/sdk7.png[Run the sample application and log in to the app]

. Under “Please Take a Moment to Create an Account”, check the “New User” box and enter any arbitrary username and password to create an account and sign in.
+

. Click the globe icon in the upper right corner to go to the hotel search page.
+
image::connect-sdk-cbc/sdk9.png[Go to the hotel search page]

. Enter a search term such as “bed & breakfast” in “San Francisco”, then click btn:[Find Hotels].
+
image::connect-sdk-cbc/sdk10.png[Enter a search term and click the Find Hotels button]
+
The hotel search feature in the Sample Application uses the “hotels” Full Text Search index you created on your Couchbase Cloud cluster in the xref:cbc-self-service-trials:getting-started.adoc[previous tutorial].

Congratulations, you have successfully connected a working Node.js application to your cluster on Couchbase Cloud!
